AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We analysed data obtained from the electronic patient records 
of inpatients with diabetes admitted to a large university hospital to 
understand the prevalence and distribution of inpatient hypoglycaemia.
METHODS: The study was conducted using electronic patient record data from 
Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The dataset contains hospital 
admission data for patients coded for diabetes. We used the recently agreed 
definition for a level 1 hypoglycaemia episode as any blood glucose measurement 
<4Â mmol/l and a level 2 hypoglycaemia episode as any blood glucose measurement 
<3Â mmol/l. Any two or more consecutive low blood glucose measurements within a 
2Â h time window were considered as one single hypoglycaemic episode.
RESULTS: We analysed data obtained from 17,658 inpatients with diabetes (1696 
with type 1 diabetes, 14,006 with type 2 diabetes, and 1956 with other forms of 
diabetes; 9277 men; mean Â± SD age, 66â€‰Â±â€‰18Â years) who underwent 32,758 hospital 
admissions between July 2014 and August 2018. The incidence of level 1 
hypoglycaemia was 21.5% and the incidence of level 2 hypoglycaemia was 9.6%. 
Recurrent level 1 and level 2 hypoglycaemia occurred, respectively, in 51% and 
39% of hospital admissions in people with type 2 diabetes with at least one 
hypoglycaemic episode, and in 55% and 45% in those with type 1 diabetes. The 
incidence of level 2 hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes, when 
corrected for the number of people who remained in hospital, remained constant 
for the first 100Â h at approximately 0.15 events per h per admission. With 
regards to the hypoglycaemia distribution during the day, after correcting for 
the number of blood glucose tests per h, there were two clear spikes in the rate 
of hypoglycaemia approximately 3Â h after lunch and after dinner. The highest 
rate of hypoglycaemia per glucose test was seen between 01:00 hours and 05:00 
hours. Medication had a significant impact on the incidence of level 2 
hypoglycaemia, ranging from 1.5% in people with type 2 diabetes on metformin 
alone to 33% in people treated with a combination of rapid-acting insulin 
analogue, long-acting insulin analogue and i.v.-administered insulin.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Retrospective analysis of data from electronic 
patient records enables clinicians to gain a greater understanding of the 
incidence and distribution of inpatient hypoglycaemia. This information should 
be used to drive evidence-based improvements in the glycaemic control of 
inpatients through targeted medication adjustment for specific populations at 
high risk of hypoglycaemia.

OBJECTIVE: Even though trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has been demonstrated to 
interfere with atherosclerosis and diabetes pathophysiology, the association 
between TMAO and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) has not been 
specifically established in type 2 diabetes (T2D).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the association of plasma TMAO 
concentrations with MACE and all-cause mortality in a single-center prospective 
cohort of consecutively recruited patients with T2D.
RESULTS: The study population consisted in 1463 SURDIENE participants (58% men), 
aged 65â€…Â±â€…10 years. TMAO concentrations were significantly associated with 
diabetes duration, renal function, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, soluble 
tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) concentrations (R2 = 0.27) and were 
significantly higher in patients on metformin, even after adjustment for 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): 6.7 (8.5) vs 8.5 (13.6) Âµmol/L, 
respectively (PeGFR-adjusted = 0.0207). During follow-up (median duration 
[interquartile range], 85 [75] months), 403 MACE and 538 deaths were registered. 
MACE-free survival and all-cause mortality were significantly associated with 
the quartile distribution of TMAO concentrations, patients with the highest TMAO 
levels displaying the greatest risk of outcomes (Pâ€…<â€…0.0001). In multivariate 
Cox models, compared with patients from the first 3 quartiles, those from the 
fourth quartile of TMAO concentration had an independently increased risk for 
MACE: adjusted hazard ratio (adjHR) 1.32 (1.02-1.70); Pâ€…=â€…0.0325. Similarly, 
TMAO was significantly associated with mortality in multivariate analysis: adjHR 
1.75 (1.17-2.09); Pâ€…=â€…0.0124, but not when sTNFR1 and angiopoietin like 2 were 
considered: adjHR 1.16 (0.95-1.42); Pâ€…=â€…0.1514.
CONCLUSIONS: We revealed an association between higher TMAO concentrations and 
increased risk of MACE and all-cause mortality, thereby opening some avenues on 
the role of dysbiosis in cardiovascular risk, in T2D patients.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Agriophyllum squarrosum (L.) Moq. is a 
traditional Mongol medicine generally used to treat diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effects and potential mechanisms of 
Agriophyllum oligosaccharides (AOS) on liver injury in type 2 diabetic db/db 
mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The db/db mice were divided into the model group (Model), 
metformin group (MET), high-dose AOS group (HAOS), and low-dose AOS group 
(LAOS). Nondiabetic littermate control db/m mice were used as the normal control 
group (Control). Mice in AOS groups were treated with AOS (380 or 750Â mg/kg) 
daily, for 8 weeks. At 8 weeks, blood samples were collected to detect lipid and 
enzyme parameters concerning hepatic function, including alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total protein (TP), 
albumin (ALB), globulin (GLB), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Random blood glucose (RBG) test, 
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and oral maltose tolerance test (OMTT) were 
also conducted. Microscopy was used to observe morphological changes in the 
liver of AOS-treated groups. Real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA 
expression, including insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), phosphatidylinositol 
3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor (PPAR)-Î³, insulin receptor (INS-R), and Glut4. Furthermore, western 
blotting was performed to identify proteins, including phosphorylation of IRS-2 
(p-IRS-2), PI3K, p-AKT, PPAR-Î³, INS-R, and Glut4. Hepatic protein expression of 
p-IRS-2, PI3K, p-AKT, PPAR-Î³, INS-R, and Glut4 was observed using 
immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: AOS treatment significantly decreased RBG, OGTT, and OMTT in mice, as 
well as serum ALT and AST activities. AOS groups demonstrated significantly 
higher expressions of p-IRS-2, PI3K, PPAR-Î³, p-AKT, INS-R, and Glut4 protein and 
IRS-2, PI3K, AKT, PPAR-Î³, INS-R, and Glut4 mRNA in the liver tissue of db/db 
mice; the degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes and formation of collagen 
fibres markedly reduced, improving the structural disorder in the liver.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that AOS could protect the liver in type 2 
diabetes, in part by activating insulin in the INS-R/IRS2/PI3K/AKT/Glut4/PPAR-Î³ 
signal pathway, facilitating hepatocyte proliferation, and further reducing the 
blood glucose levels.

This study aims to verify in experimental models of hyperglycemia induced by 
streptozotocin (STZ-DM) to what degree the high competition between unlabeled 
glucose and metformin (MET) treatment might affect the accuracy of cancer FDG 
imaging. The study included 36 "control" and 36 "STZ-DM" Balb/c mice, undergoing 
intraperitoneal injection of saline or streptozotocin, respectively. Two-weeks 
later, mice were subcutaneously implanted with breast (4 T1) or colon (CT26) 
cancer cells and subdivided in three subgroups for treatment with water or with 
MET at 10 or 750 mg/Kg/day. Two weeks after, mice were submitted to micro-PET 
imaging. Enzymatic pathways and response to oxidative stress were evaluated in 
harvested tumors. Finally, competition by glucose, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and the 
fluorescent analog 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose 
(2-NBDG) on FDG uptake was studied in 4 T1 and CT26 cultured cells. STZ-DM 
slightly decreased cancer volume and FDG uptake rate (MRF). More importantly, it 
also abolished MET capability to decelerate lesion growth and MRF. This 
metabolic reprogramming closely agreed with the activity of hexose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase within the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, co-incubation with 2DG 
virtually abolished FDG and 2-NBDG uptake within the endoplasmic reticulum in 
cultured cells. These data challenge the current dogma linking FDG uptake to 
glycolytic flux and introduce a new model to explain the relation between 
glucose analogue uptake and hexoses reticular metabolism. This selective fate of 
FDG contributes to the preserved sensitivity of PET imaging in oncology even in 
chronic moderate hyperglycemic conditions.

Metformin in Oncology - How Far Is Its Repurposing as an Anticancer Drug?

[Article in English]

PÃ¡cal L, KaÅˆkovÃ¡ K.

BACKGROUND: Metformin is the most commonly used antidiabetic drug with a 
plethora of proven metabolic and cardiovascular beneficial effects and 
exceptional safety profile. On top of the established metabolic effects, 
retrospective epidemiologic evidence shows that metformin use is associated with 
decreased cancer risk and/or improved disease prognosis in diabetic cancer 
patients on metformin compared to those treated with different antidiabetic 
drugs. This is a sound argument for eventual repurposing metformin as an 
adjuvant drug in oncology; however, evidence-based data are currently needed to 
establish this. Metformin is a biguanide that in the context of type 2 diabetes 
primarily targets the liver. Metformin inhibits oxidative phosphorylation which 
leads to the suppression of gluconeogenesis and causes decrease of blood glucose 
concentration. Mechanisms responsible for metformin anti-neoplastic effect have 
been investigated extensively, and key events seem to centralize around its 
ability to induce intracellular energetic stress with subsequent changes of 
metabolism resulting in cytostatic or cytotoxic action. Large clinical 
experience with metformin in the treatment of diabetes together with its 
plausible effects on different cancer cell types initiated a number of clinical 
trials that tested the hypothesis that metformin might have a beneficial effect 
in the treatment of cancer.
PURPOSE: The aim of this review is to compile recent advances in our 
understanding of metformin antineoplastic effects and to give a summary of the 
results of recent clinical trials of metformin for treatment of different cancer 
types.

BACKGROUND: Recent randomized control trials have described a protective 
cardiovascular effect of novel glucose lowering drugs in patients at high 
cardiovascular risk. Whether these second-line agents have similar effects in 
the general population is unknown. We aimed to compare the risk of major 
cardiovascular and adverse events in new users of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
inhibitors (SGLT-2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i), glucagon-like 
peptide 1 agonist (GLP-1a), and sulfonylurea in T2DM patients not controlled on 
metformin therapy.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the MarketScan database (2011-2015). 
We selected T2DM individuals who were newly dispensed sulfonylureas, SGLT-2i, 
DPP-4i, or GLP-1a, as second-line therapy, added to metformin. Cohort entry was 
defined by date of first prescription of the second-line agent. Time to first 
non-fatal cardiovascular or adverse event was compared using Cox regression 
models adjusted for confounders.
RESULTS: Among 118,341 T2DM patients using metformin (mean age: 56), most were 
at low cardiovascular risk (4% with previous cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
event). During a median follow-up of 10Â months compared with sulfonylureas 
users, cardiovascular risk was lower in users of SGLT-2i (aHRÂ =Â 0.61; 95% CI: 
0.40-0.97), DPP-4i (aHRÂ =Â 0.79; 95% CI: 0.69-0.90) and GLP-1a (aHRÂ =Â 0.65; 95% 
CI: 0.48-0.89). Serious adverse events were rare but compared with sulfonylurea, 
the risk was lower in new users of novel glucose lowering agents.
CONCLUSION: In our analyses, which included patients with and without prior 
cardiovascular disease, initiating novel glucose lowering drugs as second-line 
therapy for T2DM was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular and adverse 
events than sulfonylurea initiation.

Metformin is a safe, effective and useful drug for glucose management in 
patients with diabetes. However in recent years, more attention has been paid to 
the possibility of using metformin as an anti-aging drug. It was shown to 
significantly increase the lifespan in some model organisms and delay the onset 
of age-associated declines. The current review summarizes advances in clinical 
research on the potential role of metformin in the field of lifespan and 
healthspan extension. Growing amounts of evidence from clinical trials suggest 
that metformin can effectively reduce the risk of many age-related diseases and 
conditions, including cardiometabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, chronic 
inflammation and frailty. Metformin also holds promise as a drug that could be 
repurposed for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy for certain types of cancer. 
Moreover, metformin induces autophagy by activation of AMPK and can thus be 
potentially used to promote heathspan by hormesis-like mechanisms. Although 
long-term intake of metformin is associated with low risk of adverse events, 
well-designed clinical trials are still required to uncover the potential use of 
this drug as a geroprotector.

Preclinical data suggests anti-lymphoma potential for statins, metformin and 
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. We performed a retrospective 
population-based study of all adults aged â‰¥66 years diagnosed with diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or transformed lymphoma treated with a rituximab 
containing regimen, between 2005 and 2015 in Ontario, Canada. Using 
administrative databases, we assessed the impact of medication exposures, prior 
to chemo-immunotherapy, on lymphoma survival. Cox regression analyses, 
controlling for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities, examined the 
relationship between medication exposure and survival. In total, 4913 patients 
were treated with curative intent (median age 75 years, 51% male) and 52Â·2% died 
at a median of 1 year from treatment initiation (67% due to DLBCL). In the year 
prior to commencing treatment, 45Â·7% received statins, 16Â·3% metformin, and 
25Â·0% a COX-2 inhibitor. Adjusting for confounders, exposure to statin and COX-2 
inhibitors prior to chemo-immunotherapy independently conferred a survival 
advantage: statin exposure for 30 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0Â·97, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0Â·96-0Â·98), 180 days (HR 0Â·84, 95% CI 0Â·80-0Â·89) and 365 days (HR 
0Â·71, 95% CI 0Â·63-0Â·79) and COX-2 inhibitor exposure for 30 days (HR 0Â·95, 95% 
CI 0Â·95-0Â·98), 180 days (HR 0Â·76, 95% CI 0Â·66-0Â·86) and 365 days (HR 0Â·57, 95% 
CI 0Â·43-0Â·74). Metformin had no significant impact. This population-based study 
found a dose-related survival benefit of exposure to statins and COX-2 
inhibitors prior to chemo-immunotherapy for newly diagnosed DLBCL.

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: To assess the efficacy and safety of 
metformin/sitagliptin-based dual/triple therapy in elderly Chinese patients with 
typeÂ 2 diabetes mellitus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This subgroup analysis included individuals aged 
â‰¥65Â years from the STRATEGY study, a two-stage study in which typeÂ 2 diabetes 
mellitus patients with unsatisfactory glycemic control on metformin were first 
treated with the dual combination of metformin and sitagliptin for 16Â weeks 
(nÂ =Â 681), and then, if glycemic control had not been achieved, were treated 
with a third add-on oral antihyperglycemic drug for another 24Â weeks (nÂ =Â 291). 
The efficacy end-point was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in each stage, 
and the safety end-point was adverse events with a focus on hypoglycemia.
RESULTS: At weekÂ 16, the change in HbA1c was -0.81% from baseline, and the 
percentages of patients who achieved HbA1c targets of <7% and <7.5% were 44.9 
and 67.2%, respectively. After 24Â weeks, a further average HbA1c reduction of 
-0.60% was observed with specific reductions of -0.70% with glimepiride, -0.63% 
with gliclazide, -0.51% with repaglinide and -0.45% with acarbose. The 
proportions of patients who achieved HbA1c targets of <7% and <7.5% were 65.4 
and 81.3%, respectively, over the entire study. The rates of drug-related 
adverse events and hypoglycemia were, respectively, 4.1 and 4.3% in the dual 
therapy stage, and 5.2% and 7.1% in the triple therapy stage, without occurrence 
of severe hypoglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly Chinese typeÂ 2 diabetes mellitus patients, 
metformin/sitagliptin-based dual and triple oral therapy can provide clinically 
meaningful glycemic control and is generally well tolerated with a low incidence 
of hypoglycemia.

OBJECTIVES: Over 25% of nursing home residents have diabetes. Nurses (registered 
nurses and registered practical nurses), registered dietitians and personal 
support workers (PSWs) provide the bulk of diabetes care in long-term care (LTC) 
homes, but their self-rated diabetes knowledge is poor. In this study, we 
evaluated the impact of an educational intervention on comfort with, and 
knowledge of, diabetes management among frontline LTC staff.
METHODS: We implemented an educational intervention in 2 LTC homes in Ontario 
that targeted nurses and dietitians, PSWs and physicians. A self-assessment 
questionnaire and a knowledge test were administered to nurses and dietitians 
and PSWs before and after the intervention. We also measured pre- and 
postintervention glycated hemoglobin levels, use of sliding scale insulin and 
type and dose of diabetes medications prescribed.
RESULTS: After the intervention, both the nurses and dietitians and PSWs groups 
demonstrated increased comfort with diabetes management and improved 
self-appraised knowledge. Among PSWs, knowledge of foot care improved the most, 
and the nurses and dietitians group had the greatest improvement in knowledge of 
blood glucose monitoring. In addition, there was reduced use of sliding scale 
insulin, and in the number of residents requiring renal-based dose reductions of 
glucose-lowering medications. This intervention was innovative as it targeted 
different LTC health-care providers; it demonstrated the potential to increase 
LTC health-care providers' confidence in diabetes management. Future studies 
could assess the clinical benefits of an educational intervention on rates of 
hypoglycemia and improving A1C targets.
CONCLUSIONS: An educational intervention can improve knowledge and comfort of 
diabetes management of frontline LTC staff.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Psidium guajava L. (Myrtaceae) leaves are used 
as an herbal antidiabetic remedy in several parts of the world. On Madagascar, 
both the bark and leaves are used for treatment of diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dilution series of ethanolic extracts of P. guajava 
leaves and bark were used for determining inhibitory activities against yeast 
Î±-glucosidase and porcine Î±-amylase. Skeletal muscle glucose uptake was measured 
using 2-deoxy-D-(1-3H)-glucose in murine C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Hepatic 
glucose-6-phosphatase activity in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells and triglyceride 
accumulation in murine 3T3-L1 adipocyte-like cells were assessed using Wako 
AutoKit Glucose assays and AdipoRed reagent, respectively. Cells were incubated 
for 18Â h with the maximal non-toxic concentrations of the plant extracts 
determined by the lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay.
RESULTS: Ethanolic extracts of P. guajava leaf and bark inhibited Î±-glucosidase 
with IC50 values of 1.0Â Â±Â 0.3 and 0.5Â Â±Â 0.01Â Î¼g/mL, respectively. In the 
Î±-amylase inhibition assay, the ethanolic extract of bark of P. guajava showed 
an IC50 value of 10.6Â Â±Â 0.4Â Î¼g/mL. None of the extracts were able to reduce 
glucose-6-phosphatase activity in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. In contrast, P. 
guajava leaf extract significantly increased 2-deoxy-D-[1-3H]-glucose uptake in 
C2C12 muscle cells (161.4Â Â±Â 10.1%, pÂ =Â 0.0015) in comparison to the dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle control, as did the reference compounds metformin 
(144.0Â Â±Â 7.7%, pÂ =Â 0.0345) and insulin (141.5Â Â±Â 13.8%, pÂ =Â 0.0495). Furthermore, 
P. guajava leaf and bark extracts, as well as the reference compound 
rosiglitazone, significantly enhanced triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells 
(252.6Â Â±Â 14.2%, pÂ <Â 0.0001, 211.1Â Â±Â 12.7%, pÂ <Â 0.0001, and 201.1Â Â±Â 9.2%, 
pÂ <Â 0.0001, respectively) to levels higher than the DMSO vehicle control. 
Moreover, P. guajava leaf extract significantly enhanced the triglyceride 
accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells compared to rosiglitazone.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that P. guajava leaf and bark extracts can 
be used as a natural source of Î±-glucosidase inhibitors. In addition, the bark 
extract of P. guajava was an effective Î±-amylase inhibitor. Moreover, P. guajava 
leaf extract improved glucose uptake in muscle cells, while both leaf and bark 
extracts enhanced the triglyceride content in adipocytes in culture. P. guajava 
leaf and bark extracts may thus hypothetically have future applications in the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Growing amounts of evidence from clinical trials suggest that metformin can effectively reduce the risk of many age-related diseases and conditions, including cardiometabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, chronic inflammation and frailty. Metformin also holds promise as a drug that could be repurposed for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy for certain types of cancer. Moreover, metformin induces autophagy by activation of AMPK and can thus be potentially used to promote heathspan by hormesis-like mechanisms. Although long-term intake of metformin is associated with low risk of adverse events, well-designed clinical trials are still required to uncover the potential use of this drug as a geroprotector.
