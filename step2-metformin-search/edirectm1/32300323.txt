Metformin is a safe, effective and useful drug for glucose management in patients with diabetes. However in recent years, more attention has been paid to the possibility of using metformin as an anti-aging drug. It was shown to significantly increase the lifespan in some model organisms and delay the onset of age-associated declines. The current review summarizes advances in clinical research on the potential role of metformin in the field of lifespan and healthspan extension. Growing amounts of evidence from clinical trials suggest that metformin can effectively reduce the risk of many age-related diseases and conditions, including cardiometabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, chronic inflammation and frailty. Metformin also holds promise as a drug that could be repurposed for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy for certain types of cancer. Moreover, metformin induces autophagy by activation of AMPK and can thus be potentially used to promote heathspan by hormesis-like mechanisms. Although long-term intake of metformin is associated with low risk of adverse events, well-designed clinical trials are still required to uncover the potential use of this drug as a geroprotector.
