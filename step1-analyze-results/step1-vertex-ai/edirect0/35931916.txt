BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors driving recruitment and enrollment of 
African Americans (AA)s in clinical translational research will assure that 
underrepresented populations benefit from scientific progress and new 
developments in the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related 
disorders. While transportation is pivotal to volunteers' ability to participate 
in research, its contribution to enrollment in exercise studies on AD is yet to 
be elucidated. Thus, this research focuses on identifying factors that influence 
the recruitment and enrollment of African Americans in biomedical studies and 
determining whether the availability of transportation motivates participation 
in time-demanding exercise studies on AD.
METHODS: We analyzed recruitment data collected from 567 volunteers ages 55 and 
older screened through various recruitment sources and considered for enrollment 
in our exercise and memory study. To determine whether transportation influenced 
the enrollment of African Americans (AA)s in biomedical studies, multiple 
logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant factors that 
drive enrollment. Furthermore, the association of race and demographic factors 
on the availability of transportation was assessed.
RESULTS: Demographic factors, age at screening, education, gender, and cognitive 
scores were not significantly different among those enrolled compared to control 
(not-enrolled). In the relationship of enrollment to transportation, enrolled 
participants were more likely to have access to transportation (79.12%) than 
not-enrolled participants who had less access to transportation (71.6%); 
however, the association was not statistically significant. However, race 
differentially influenced the likelihood of enrollment, with elderly AAs being 
significantly less likely to have transportation (p = 0.020) than the Whites but 
more likely than "others" to have transportation.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that access to transportation may be a key 
factor motivating enrollment in an exercise and memory study in a predominantly 
AA sample. Notably, AAs in our sample were less likely to have transportation 
than Whites. Other demographic factors and cognitive scores did not 
significantly influence enrollment in our sample. A larger sample and more 
detailed assessment of transportation are needed to further discern the role of 
transportation in clinical trials.
