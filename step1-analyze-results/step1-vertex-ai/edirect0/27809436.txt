The first comprehensive pediatric dyslipidemia guidelines were published by the 
National Cholesterol Education Program’s Expert Panel on Blood Cholesterol 
Levels in Children and Adolescents in 1992 and were updated by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1998. In 2008 the AAP issued an updated clinical 
report detailing recommendations for screening and evaluation of cholesterol 
levels in children and adolescents as well as prevention and treatment 
strategies. Since the publication of the first guidelines, rates of pediatric 
obesity have significantly increased, resulting in a concomitant increase in 
dyslipidemia. Recently, options for pharmacotherapeutic interventions in 
pediatric patients have expanded with new FDA approved indications of several 
lipid lowering medications, as well as additional safety and efficacy data. In 
2011, The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) published its 
comprehensive report Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk 
Reduction in Children and Adolescents. As with previous guidelines, lifestyle 
modifications with an emphasis on a heart-healthy diet and daily moderate to 
vigorous exercise remain an integral part of treatment for pediatric lipid 
disorders; however, the recommendations for patients requiring management with 
pharmacotherapy have changed, and will be the focus of this discussion. For
