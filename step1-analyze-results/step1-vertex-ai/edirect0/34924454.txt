BACKGROUND: This 3.6-year prospective study examined combined impacts of 
physical activity, dietary variety, and social interaction on incident 
disability and estimated population-attributable fraction for disability 
reduction in older adults.
METHODS: Participants were 7,822 initially non-disabled residents (3,966 men and 
3,856 women) aged 65-84 years of Ota City, Tokyo, Japan. Sufficiency of 
moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) ≥150 min/week, dietary 
variety score (DVS) ≥3 (median), and social interaction (face-to-face and/or 
non-face-to-face) ≥1 time/week was assessed using self-administered 
questionnaires. Disability incidence was prospectively identified using the 
long-term care insurance system's nationally unified database.
RESULTS: During a follow-up of 3.6 years, 1,046 (13.4%) individuals had 
disabilities. Independent multivariate-hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) of MVPA, DVS, and social interaction sufficiency for incident 
disability were 0.68 (95% CI, 0.59-0.78), 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77-0.99), and 0.90 
(95% CI, 0.79-1.03), respectively. Incident disability HRs gradually reduced 
with increased frequency of satisfying these behaviors (any one: HR 0.82; 95% 
CI, 0.65-1.03; any two: HR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.82; and all three behaviors: HR 
0.54; 95% CI, 0.43-0.69), in an inverse dose-response manner (P < 0.001 for 
trend). Population-attributable fraction for disability reduction in satisfying 
any one, any two, and all three behaviors were 4.0% (95% CI, -0.2 to 7.9%), 9.6% 
(95% CI, 4.8-14.1%), and 16.0% (95% CI, 8.7-22.8%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Combining physical activity, dietary variety, and social interaction 
substantially enhances the impacts on preventing disability among older adults, 
with evidence of an inverse dose-response manner. Improving insufficient 
behavior elements through individual habits and preexisting social group 
activities may be effective in preventing disability in the community.
