The role of exercise in preventing osteoporotic fractures is vague, and further 
recommendations for optimized exercise protocols are very rare. In the present 
work, we provided positive evidence for exercise effects on the number of 
osteoporotic fractures in adults, albeit without observing any significant 
relevance of intensity progression or study duration.
INTRODUCTION: Osteoporotic fractures are a major challenge confronting our aging 
society. Exercise might be an efficient agent for reducing osteoporotic 
fractures in older adults, but the most promising exercise protocol for that 
purpose has yet to be identified. The present meta-analysis thus aimed to 
identify important predictors of the exercise effect on osteoporotic fractures 
in adults.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of six literature databases according 
to the PRISMA guideline that included controlled exercise studies and reported 
the number of low-trauma major osteoporotic fractures separately for exercise 
(EG) and control (CG) groups. Primary study outcome was incidence ratio (IR) for 
major osteoporotic fractures. Sub-analyses were conducted for progression of 
intensity (yes vs. no) during the trial and the study duration (≤ 12 months 
vs. > 12 months).
RESULTS: In summary, 11 studies with a pooled number of 9715 participant-years 
in the EG and 9592 in the CG were included. The mixed-effects conditional 
Poisson regression revealed positive exercise effects on major osteoporotic 
fractures (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.54-0.94, p = .006). Although studies with 
intensity progression were more favorable, our subgroup analysis did not 
determine significant differences for diverging intensity progression (p = .133) 
or study duration (p = .883). Heterogeneity among the trials of the subgroups 
(I2 ≤ 0-7.1%) was negligible.
CONCLUSION: The present systematic review and meta-analysis provided significant 
evidence for the favorable effect of exercise on major osteoporotic fractures. 
However, diverging study and exercise characteristics along with the close 
interaction of exercise parameters prevented the derivation of reliable 
recommendations for exercise protocols for fracture reductions.
