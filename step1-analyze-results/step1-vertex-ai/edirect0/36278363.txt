BACKGROUND: High collision rates and frequency of entering the opening from 
non-paretic sides are associated with collision in individuals with stroke.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with collision avoidance behavior when 
individuals with stroke walked through narrow openings.
METHODS: Participants with subacute or chronic stroke walked through a narrow 
opening and had to avoid colliding with obstacles. Multiple regression analyses 
were conducted with pathophysiology, motor function, and judgment ability as 
predictor variables; collision rate and frequency of entering the opening from 
non-paretic sides were outcome variables.
RESULTS: Sixty-one eligible individuals with stroke aged 63±12 years were 
enrolled. Thirty participants collided twice or more and 37 entered the opening 
from the non-paretic side. Higher collision occurrence was associated with 
slower Timed Up and Go tests and left-right sway (odds ratios, 1.2 and 5.6; 95% 
confidence intervals, 1.1-1.3 and 1.3-28.2; p = .008 and.025, respectively). 
Entering from non-paretic sides was associated with lesions in the thalamus, 
left-sided hemiplegia, and Brunnstrom stage 3 or lower (odds ratios, 6.6, 8.7, 
and 6.7; 95% confidence intervals, 1.3-52.5, 2.5-36.5, and 1.2-57.5; and 
p = .038,.001, and.048, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Walking ability is associated with avoiding obstacle collision, 
while pathophysiological characteristics and degree of paralysis are associated 
with a preference for which side of the body enters an opening first. 
Interventions to improve walking ability may improve collision avoidance. 
Avoidance behavior during intervention varies depending on the lesion position.
