AIM: We planned a cross-sectional investigation (study 1) and a longitudinal 
training intervention (study 2) to investigate whether recreational dancing 
affords greater neuroprotective effects against age-related neuromuscular 
junction (NMJ) degeneration compared to general fitness exercise training.
METHODS: In study 1, we recruited 19 older volunteers regularly practising 
dancing (older dancers [OD]) and 15 recreationally physically active older 
individuals (OA) and physical performance, muscle morphology, muscle function, 
and NMJ stability (from serum C-terminal agrin fragment [CAF] concentration) 
were assessed. In study 2, employing a longitudinal study design in a different 
cohort (composed of 37 older adults), we aimed to study whether a 6-month 
dancing intervention decreased CAF concentration compared to general fitness 
exercise training in older adults.
RESULTS: Our findings show that OD had a lower CAF concentration (suggesting an 
increased NMJ stability) compared to OA. This result was accompanied by superior 
functional performance despite no differences in muscle size. In study 2, we 
observed a reduction in CAF concentration only in the dancing group.
CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings suggest that dancing is an effective 
training modality to promote neuroprotection and increase muscle function in 
healthy older individuals.
