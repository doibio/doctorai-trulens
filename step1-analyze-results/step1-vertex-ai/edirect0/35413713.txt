INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the associations of time 
spent away from bed with whole-body muscle mass and swallowing function in older 
adults with low activities of daily living (ADL).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Tokyo Medical and Dental 
University and included adults over 65 years of age who underwent a medical 
intervention at their residence. Data regarding age, sex, body height and 
weight, activity status, medical history, time spent away from bed, and 
Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) were collected. We calculated the body mass 
index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, whole-body muscle mass, the appendicular 
skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), and the trunk muscle mass index (TMI). 
According to the time spent away from bed, the subjects were grouped as follows: 
<4 but ≥0 h (S), <6 but ≥4 h (M), and ≥6 h (L). These variables were analyzed 
using the one-way analysis of variance, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the χ2 
test, then differences among the three groups were examined. To adjust for 
confounding factors, we performed multiple regression analysis with ASMI and TMI 
as the dependent variables and ordinal logistic regression analysis with FOIS as 
the objective variable.
RESULTS: Ninety subjects (male: n = 42; female: n = 48; mean age = 82.9 ± 8.8 
years, and groups S: n = 23; M: n = 30; L: n = 37) were analyzed. Group L had a 
significantly higher ASMI, TMI, and FOIS score than groups S and M, while group 
M had a significantly higher ASMI and FOIS score than group S. After adjusting 
for confounding factors, the significant explanatory factors for ASMI were sex, 
activity status, time spent away from bed, and TMI. The factors for TMI were 
activity status, time spent away from bed, ASMI, and FOIS. The factors for FOIS 
were time spent away from bed and TMI.
CONCLUSION: Spending 4 or more hours away from the bed is related to 
appendicular skeletal muscle mass and FOIS, while spending 6 or more hours is 
related to appendicular skeletal muscle mass, trunk muscle mass, and FOIS in 
this population. These findings highlight factors that can prevent a decline in 
swallowing function in the daily life of older adults with low ADL who have 
difficulty performing exercises to preserve swallowing function.
