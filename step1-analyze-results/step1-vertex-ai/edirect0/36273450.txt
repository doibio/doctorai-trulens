INTRODUCTION: Gait variability is associated with frailty, dementia, and falls. 
Studies on the association of physiological and cognitive factors with gait 
variability have seldom included middle-aged adults, even though these adults 
already experienced loss of muscular strength and postural stability. This study 
aimed a) to examine and compare the trend of gait variability in men and women, 
across the adult age spectrum, and b) to identify and compare the contributions 
of physiological and cognitive factors to gait variability.
METHODS: This was a population-based cross-sectional study at a single center. A 
random sample of 507 community-dwelling, well-functioning adults aged 21-90 
years were studied. Cognition was measured using the Repeatable Battery for the 
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Physiological factors examined included 
visual contrast sensitivity (VCS), postural sway, hand reaction time, handgrip 
strength (HGS), knee extensor strength, and gait variability (coefficient of 
variation [CoV]). Multivariable regression models were used to examine the 
association between physiological and cognitive performance with gait CoV.
RESULTS: Women walked with greater stride width CoV (p < 0.01) and double 
support time (DST) CoV (p < 0.01) than men. The stride width (p = 0.01) and DST 
variability (p = 0.03) were significantly higher in older men as compared to men 
in younger age-groups. Gait speed accounted for most of the gait CoV variances 
and attenuated the effects of physiological performance and/or attention 
cognition on most gait variability, except for CoV of DST and stride width. 
Adults with better VCS (β = -0.19), faster hand reaction (β = 0.12), and greater 
HGS (β = -0.15) had lower variability in step length.
CONCLUSION: The trends of stride width CoV and DST CoV across adult age spectrum 
were different between men and women. Greater stride width variability was 
partly attributed to greater HGS, possibly to better control lateral stability 
during walking. Physiological factors outweigh cognition in regulating most of 
the gait CoV in this study. They are modifiable and potential targets for 
healthy aging program.
