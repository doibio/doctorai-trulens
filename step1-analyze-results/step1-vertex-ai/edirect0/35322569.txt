INTRODUCTION: Pain remains largely undertreated in older adults irrespective of 
health care setting. Mexican American adults in the United States have a high 
age-adjusted prevalence of obesity. However, the association of pain and obesity 
with physical function is understudied in this population.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of co-occurring pain and obesity with 
physical function over 20 years of follow-up in a cohort of older Mexican 
Americans who scored ≥7 (moderate to high) in the Short Physical Performance 
Battery (SPPB) test and were nondisabled at baseline.
DESIGN: Longitudinal population-based study.
SETTING: Community-dwelling older adults from Southwestern United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Mexican American adults age 65 years and older.
INTERVENTIONS: Not Applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical function was assessed with the SPPB test 
(standing balance, timed 8-ft walk, and five repeated timed chair stands). 
Participants at baseline were divided into four groups: no pain-no obesity 
(n = 869), obesity only (n = 282), pain only (n = 216), and pain-obesity 
(n = 159). Generalized Estimating Equation models were used to estimate the odds 
ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of lower performance in physical 
function over 20 years as a function of pain-obesity grouping.
RESULTS: Participants with pain only (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.34-1.95) and with 
co-occurring pain and obesity (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.83-2.95) had significantly 
greater odds of physical function impairment over those with no pain-no obesity 
or obesity only, after controlling for all covariates.
CONCLUSION: Older Mexican American adults were at high risk for physical 
function impairment over time if they had pain or co-occurring pain and obesity. 
Early assessment and proper pain management as well as maintaining a healthy 
weight may reduce declines in physical function in older Mexican American 
adults.
