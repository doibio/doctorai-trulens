INTRODUCTION: Evidence suggests that maintaining a higher level of 
cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) later in life can offer some protection against 
brain volume loss as we age. By contrast, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) 
could accelerate age-related cortical atrophy. The current study sought to 
examine whether variations in the CRF level modified the association between 
mTBI history and brain volumetric measures in a sample of older adults.
METHODS: Seventy-nine community-dwelling older adults (mean age 68.7 ± 4.3 
years, 54.4% female) were assessed for their mTBI history: 25 participants (32%) 
reported sustaining at least one lifetime mTBI. Participants also underwent a 
CRF assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to obtain global and 
region-of-interest volumes.
RESULTS: Analysis of covariance, controlling for age, sex, education, and 
apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 allele carriage, revealed that participants with a 
history of mTBI had a significantly larger total mean grey matter volume (582.21 
± 12.46 cm3) in comparison to participants with no mTBI history (571.08 ± 17.21 
cm3, p = 0.01 after correction for multiple comparisons). However, no 
differences between groups based on mTBI history were found for total white 
matter volume or in any other cortical or subcortical structures examined. A 
subsequent moderation analysis found that CRF was predominantly non-influential 
on the association between mTBI history and the MRI-quantified measures of brain 
volume.
CONCLUSION: While unexpected, the findings suggest that a history of mTBI can 
lead to grey matter alterations in the ageing brain. However, concurrent 
variations in the CRF level did not influence the differences in brain volume 
found based on mTBI exposure status.
