Sustainable exercise strategies are needed for older adults to maintain aerobic 
capacity and strength. The objective of this pilot in 6 adults ≥ 65 years of age 
was to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of high-intensity 
functional circuit training which does not require stationary equipment. 
Instructor-led small group exercise classes were held 3x/week for 12 weeks using 
weight-bearing exercises performed in a circuit format at ratings of perceived 
exertion (RPE) of 6-8/10. All 6 participants completed the pilot and showed 
significant improvements by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The six-minute walk 
distance increased 10.5%. Timed arm curl and chair stands increased 26.8% and 
30.3% (all p ≤ 0.03). These preliminary findings suggest that high-intensity 
functional circuit exercise is feasible in older adults and increases functional 
measures of aerobic capacity and strength. Further research is warranted to 
develop this strategy which has the potential for broad dissemination without 
the need for a traditional exercise facility.
