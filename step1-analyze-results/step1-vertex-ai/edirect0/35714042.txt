OBJECTIVE: Despite growing research on sedentary behaviour and physical activity 
among hospitalised older people, there is little evidence of effective 
intervention strategies. This study sought input from clinical staff from 
various health professions on strategies to increase physical activity and 
reduce sedentariness for hospitalised older people.
METHODS: A 60-minute focus group discussion involving two physiotherapists, two 
occupational therapists, one doctor, one nurse and one social worker was 
conducted. Participants were recruited from a subacute geriatric ward and an 
acute orthopaedic ward with an orthogeriatric service at a general hospital. 
Data were thematically analysed.
RESULTS: Six strategies to reduce sedentary behaviour and increase physical 
activity were identified: clear and positive communication for patients and 
family/carers; educating patients and family/carers; involving family/carers and 
volunteers; setting physical activity goals; utilising group activities and 
activities of daily living (ADL); and making the hospital environment 
activity-friendly.
CONCLUSIONS: This research has revealed novel strategies to increase physical 
activity and reduce sedentary behaviour in hospital. The next step is to design 
interventions for testing.
