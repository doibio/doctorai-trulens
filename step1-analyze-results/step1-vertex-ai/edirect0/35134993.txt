OBJECTIVES: Effective brief instructions for self-management of chronic knee 
pain are needed.
METHODS: Forty-six participants with chronic knee pain were randomly allocated 
into two programmes: material-based education alone or brief self-exercise 
education (brief-See), which comprised a 100-minute instruction for 
self-exercise combined with compact pain education. Total function (KOOS4, 
4-subscale average of knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score), pain 
intensity (NRS, numeric rating scale), self-efficacy (PSEQ, pain self-efficacy 
questionnaire), and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D, European quality of 
life-5 dimensions) were evaluated at baseline and 4 and 12 weeks after the 
initial intervention. A generalized mixed linear model estimated average group 
differences in changes from baseline and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) 
using intention-to-treat principle.
RESULTS: Compared to material-based education alone, the brief-See provided 
significant additional improvements of 9.4% (95% CI: 2.3 to 16.4) on the KOOS4 
and 5.4 points (0.3 to 10.4) on the PSEQ at 12 weeks but did not on the NRS and 
EQ-5D. Adherence and satisfaction were favourable in the brief-See without any 
notable adverse event.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding the brief-See to material-based education could be more 
acceptable and restore total function and self-efficacy, which could contribute 
to the self-management of chronic knee pain in primary care.
