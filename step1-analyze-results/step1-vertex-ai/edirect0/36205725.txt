INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The objective was to synthesize the scientific 
evidence on the relationship of exercise with morphology and muscle function 
parameters of the female pelvic floor. The design was a systematic review.
METHODS: Searches were performed in MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, 
SCOPUS, SportDiscuss, and Google Scholar up to April 2021. Observational and 
experimental studies evaluating the morphology and/or function of the pelvic 
floor muscles (PFMs) in women were eligible. Studies reporting exercise or 
sports disciplines as exposure/intervention were included.
RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included. Compared with the control group, 
women performing vigorous and high-impact exercises exhibited lower maximum 
voluntary contraction of the PFM and those performing moderate exercise had 
better maximum voluntary contraction. Exercise practitioners had a larger hiatal 
area at rest, during contraction, and during Valsalva, and greater bladder neck 
descent than the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review demonstrate an inverse relationship of 
PFM maximum voluntary contraction with exercise intensity. Qualitative synthesis 
showed that the studies found favorable outcomes for the control group in terms 
of hiatal area during contraction and Valsalva and bladder neck displacement.
