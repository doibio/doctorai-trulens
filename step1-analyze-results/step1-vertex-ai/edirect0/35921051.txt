Exercise is a preferred strategy for improving cardiac function, especially for 
patients with cardiovascular diseases. Increasing evidence indicates that 
oxidative stress is involved in exercise-induced cardioprotection, while the 
underlying mechanism remains unclear. Furthermore, the effect of antioxidant 
supplementation during or post-exercise still exists despite divergences. To 
explore the effect of oxidative stress and antioxidant supplementation on 
cardiovascular homeostasis during or post-exercise, we take insights into the 
progress of exercise-induced oxidative stress, antioxidant supplementation, and 
cardiovascular homeostasis. In particular, antioxidants such as vitamin C or E, 
gamma-oryzanol, and other natural antioxidants are discussed concerning 
regulating exercise-associated oxidative stress. Additionally, our present study 
reviewed and discussed a meta-analysis of antioxidant supplementation during 
exercise. Overall, we take an insight into the essential biological adaptations 
in response to exercise and the effects of antioxidant supplementation on 
cardiac function, which aid us in giving recommendations on antioxidant 
supplementation for exercisers and exercised people. A better understanding of 
these issues will broaden our knowledge of exercise physiology.
