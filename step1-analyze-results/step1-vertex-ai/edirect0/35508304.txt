The European Commission Horizon 2020 project-PreventIT-evaluated two approaches 
to delivering Lifestyle-Integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) programs for 
maintaining older adults' physical function: the paper-based adapted LiFE and 
mobile health device delivered enhanced LiFE. A self-reported method was used to 
measure users' monthly adherence over 12 months. This analysis aimed to explore 
young seniors' adherence patterns between enhanced LiFE and adapted LiFE groups. 
Results showed that adherence level decreased with time in both groups. The 
enhanced LiFE group had slightly higher adherence than the adapted LiFE group 
during most of the 12 months. However, the overall adherence levels were not 
significantly different during either intervention or follow-up periods. Monthly 
self-reported adherence measurement can help to understand users' adherence 
comprehensively. The comparable adherence levels between both groups indicate 
mobile health could be an alternative to delivering home-based physical activity 
for young seniors. However, this feasibility study was not powered to detect 
differences between groups.
