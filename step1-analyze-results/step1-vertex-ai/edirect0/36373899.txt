OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of robotic-assisted gait training on 
cardiopulmonary fitness and exercise capacity for people with incomplete spinal 
cord injury.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PEDro, CENTRAL and CINAHL were searched 
from inception until September 4, 2022. Randomized controlled trials that 
evaluated the effects of robotic-assisted gait training on cardiopulmonary 
fitness and exercise capacity for individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury 
were selected. Mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were 
calculated. The methodological quality was evaluated by the Cochrane Risk of 
Bias 2.0 tool. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the time since 
injury.
RESULTS: In total 19 studies involving 770 patients were eligible for analysis. 
Individuals with acute incomplete spinal cord injury in robotic-assisted gait 
training groups showed significantly greater improvements in 6-minute walking 
test (MD 53.32; 95% CI 33.49 to 73.15; P < 0.001), lower extremity motor scale 
(MD 5.22; 95% CI 3.63 to 6.80; P < 0.001) and walking index for spinal cord 
injury II (MD 3.18; 95% CI 1.34 to 5.02; P < 0.001). Robotic-assisted gait 
training improved peak oxygen consumption to a greater degree for chronic 
incomplete spinal cord injury patients (MD 4.90; 95% CI 0.96 to 8.84; P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted gait training may be a feasible and effective 
intervention in terms of cardiopulmonary fitness and exercise capacity for 
individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury.
