OBJECTIVES: 40% of dementia cases can be prevented by addressing 12 lifestyle 
factors. These risk factors have increased presence in ethnic minorities, yet 
dementia prevention messages have not reached these communities. This article 
investigates the experience of co-designing a dementia prevention animated film 
with 9 ethnic groups in Australia.
METHODS: Evidence-based recommendations were adapted through an iterative 
process involving workshops with a stakeholder advisory committee and nine focus 
groups with 104 participants from the Arabic-, Hindi-, Tamil-, Cantonese-, 
Mandarin-, Greek-, Italian-, Spanish-, and Vietnamese-speaking communities. Data 
were analyzed using the Normalization Process Theory.
RESULTS: Cultural adaptation involves consideration of the mode of delivery, 
imagery and tone of the resource being developed; ensuring cultural adequacy; 
anticipating the need of the end-users; and managing linguistic challenges 
associated with working across multiple languages.
CONCLUSIONS: Learnings from this co-design process offer valuable insights for 
researchers and program developers who work with ethnic minority groups.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: • Adaptation across cultures and languages is a 
negotiation not a consensus building exercise• Linguistic adaptation requires 
consideration of the education levels, and linguistic and intergenerational 
preferences of community members• Co-designing across multiple languages and 
cultures risks "flattening out" key aspects of cultural specificity.
