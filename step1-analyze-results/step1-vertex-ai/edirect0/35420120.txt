AIM: The importance of endothelial cell (EC) autophagy to vascular homeostasis 
in the context of health and disease is evolving. Earlier, we reported that 
intact EC autophagy is requisite to maintain shear-stress-induced nitric oxide 
(NO) generation via glycolysis-dependent purinergic signalling to endothelial NO 
synthase (eNOS). Here, we illustrate the translational and functional 
significance of these findings.
METHODS AND RESULTS: First, we assessed translational relevance using older male 
humans and mice that exhibit blunted EC autophagy and impaired arterial function 
vs. adult controls. Active hyperaemia evoked by rhythmic handgrip 
exercise-elevated radial artery shear-rate similarly from baseline in adult and 
older subjects for 60 min. Compared with baseline, indexes of autophagy 
initiation, p-eNOSS1177 activation, and NO generation, occurred in radial artery 
ECs obtained from adult but not older volunteers. Regarding mice, indexes of 
autophagy and p-eNOSS1177 activation were robust in ECs from adult but not older 
animals that completed 60-min treadmill-running. Furthermore, 20 dyne • cm2 
laminar shear stress × 45-min increased autophagic flux, glycolysis, ATP 
production, and p-eNOSS1177 in primary arterial ECs obtained from adult but not 
older mice. Concerning functional relevance, we next questioned whether the 
inability to initiate EC autophagy, glycolysis, and p-eNOSS1177in vitro 
precipitates arterial dysfunction ex vivo. Compromised intraluminal 
flow-mediated vasodilation displayed by arteries from older vs. adult mice was 
recapitulated in vessels from adult mice by (i) NO synthase inhibition; (ii) 
acute autophagy impairment using 3-methyladenine (3-MA); (iii) EC Atg3 depletion 
(iecAtg3KO mice); (iv) purinergic 2Y1-receptor (P2Y1-R) blockade; and (v) 
germline depletion of P2Y1-Rs. Importantly, P2Y1-R activation using 
2-methylthio-ADP (2-Me-ADP) improved vasodilatory capacity in arteries from (i) 
adult mice treated with 3-MA; (ii) adult iecAtg3KO mice; and (iii) older animals 
with repressed EC autophagy.
CONCLUSIONS: Arterial dysfunction concurrent with pharmacological, genetic, and 
age-associated EC autophagy compromise is improved by activating P2Y1-Rs.
