BACKGROUND: Assessing whole-body skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and fat-free mass 
(FFM) is essential for the adequate nutritional management and training 
evaluation of athletes and trained individuals. This study aimed to determine 
the relationship between SMM assessed using the creatine (methyl-d3) dilution 
(D3-creatine) method and SMM estimated by whole-body magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) in healthy young men undergoing exercise training. Additionally, we 
examined the association between FFM measured using the four-component (4C) 
method (FFM4C) and the total body protein value estimated using 4C (TBpro4C).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed the data of 29 males (mean age, 19.9 ± 1.8 
years) who exercised regularly. SMM measurements were obtained using the 
D3-creatine method (SMMD3-creatine) and MRI (SMMMRI). The SMMD3-creatine 
adjusted to 4.3 g/SMM kg was significantly higher than SMMMRI (p < 0.01). The 
fit of the creatine pool size compared with SMMMRI was 5.0 g/SMMMRI kg. SMMMRI 
was significantly correlated with both SMMD3-creatine adjusted to 4.3 g/kg and 
5.1 g/kg. TBpro4C was significantly lower than SMMMRI (p < 0.01). Contrastingly, 
FFM4C was significantly higher than SMMMRI (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: SMMD3-creatine adjusted to 4.3 g/SMM kg-a previously reported 
value-may differ for athletes and active young males. We believe that a value of 
5.0-5.1 g/SMM kg better estimates the total muscle mass in this population. 
Traditional FFM estimation highly correlates with SMMMRI in well-trained young 
males, and the relationships appear strong enough for total body protein or SMM 
to be estimated through the FFM value.
