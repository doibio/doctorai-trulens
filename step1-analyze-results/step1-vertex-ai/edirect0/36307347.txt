Remnant cholesterol (RC) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(non-HDL-C) may contribute to the residual risk for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease. High cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with 
favorable traditional lipid profiles, but its relation with RC and non-HDL-C 
remains unclear. We analyzed cross-sectional data on 4,613 healthy men (mean age 
49 years). CRF was measured using peak oxygen uptake during incremental exercise 
testing and categorized into quartiles. RC was estimated as total cholesterol 
minus HDL-C and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated RC was defined 
as ≥38 mg/100 ml (90 percentile). Non-HDL-C was calculated as total cholesterol 
minus HDL-C, and high non-HLD-C was defined as ≥190 mg/100 ml. CRF was inversely 
associated with RC (β -0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.39 to -0.24) and 
non-HDL-C (β -0.34, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.11) after adjustment for several risk 
factors. Each metabolic equivalent increment in CRF was associated with lower 
odds of having elevated RC (odds ratio [OR] 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.93) and 
non-HDL-C (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00) in multivariable analysis. Compared 
with the bottom quartile, the top quartile of CRF had significantly lower odds 
of elevated RC (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88) and non-HDL-C (OR 0.68, 95% CI 
0.51 to 0.91). In conclusion, higher CRF was independently associated with lower 
levels of RC and non-HDL-C and lower odds of the prevalence of elevated RC and 
non-HDL-C in healthy men.
