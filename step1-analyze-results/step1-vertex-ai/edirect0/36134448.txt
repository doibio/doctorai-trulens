AIMS: Testosterone deficiency (TD) is associated with increased morbidity and 
mortality in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, data 
in women are scanty. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic 
impact of TD on women with HFrEF.
METHODS: Among 480 patients prospectively enrolled in the T.O.S.CA. (Terapia 
Ormonale Scompenso CArdiaco) registry, a prospective, multicentre, nationwide, 
observational study, 94 women were included in the current analysis. The TD was 
defined as serum testosterone levels lower than 25 ng/dl. Data regarding 
clinical status, echocardiography, exercise performance, cardiovascular 
hospitalization, and survival after an average follow-up of 36 months were 
analysed.
RESULTS: Thirty patients (31.9%) displayed TD. TD was associated with lower 
tricuspid annular plane excursion (TAPSE) to pulmonary arterial systolic 
pressure PASP ratio (TAPSE/PASP) (P = 0.008), peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) 
(P = 0.03) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (P < 0.001). TD was an 
independent predictor of the combined endpoint of all-cause 
mortality/cardiovascular hospitalization (HR: 10.45; 95% CI: 3.54-17.01; 
P = 0.001), all-cause mortality (HR: 8.33; 95%: 5.36-15.11; P = 0.039), and 
cardiovascular hospitalization (HR: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.13-4.50; P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: One-third of women with HFrEF displays TD that impacts remarkably 
on their morbidity and mortality. TD is associated with a worse clinical profile 
including exercise capacity, right ventricular-pulmonary arterial coupling, and 
renal function. These findings lend support to an accurate profiling of women 
with HF, a problem often overlooked in clinical trials.
