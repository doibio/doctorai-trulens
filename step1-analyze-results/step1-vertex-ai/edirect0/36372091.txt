AIMS: Little is known about the impact of daily physical activity timing (here 
referred to as 'chronoactivity') on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We aimed 
to examined the associations between chronoactivity and multiple CVD outcomes in 
the UK Biobank.
METHODS AND RESULTS: physical activity data were collected in the UK-Biobank 
through triaxial accelerometer over a 7-day measurement period. We used K-means 
clustering to create clusters of participants with similar chronoactivity 
irrespective of the mean daily intensity of the physical activity. 
Multivariable-adjusted Cox-proportional hazard models were used to estimate 
hazard ratios (HRs) comparing the different clusters adjusted for age and sex 
(model 1), and baseline cardiovascular risk factors (model 2). Additional 
stratified analyses were done by sex, mean activity level, and self-reported 
sleep chronotype. We included 86 657 individuals (58% female, mean age: 61.6 
[SD: 7.8] years, mean BMI: 26.6 [4.5] kg/m2). Over a follow-up period of 6 
years, 3707 incident CVD events were reported. Overall, participants with a 
tendency of late morning physical activity had a lower risk of incident coronary 
artery disease (HR: 0.84, 95%CI: 0.77, 0.92) and stroke (HR: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.70, 
0.98) compared to participants with a midday pattern of physical activity. These 
effects were more pronounced in women (P-value for interaction = 0.001). We did 
not find evidence favouring effect modification by total activity level and 
sleep chronotype.
CONCLUSION: Irrespective of total physical activity, morning physical activity 
was associated with lower risks of incident cardiovascular diseases, 
highlighting the potential importance of chronoactivity in CVD prevention.
