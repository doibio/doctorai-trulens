Exercise has long been known for its active role in improving physical fitness 
and sustaining health. Regular moderate-intensity exercise improves all aspects 
of human health and is widely accepted as a preventative and therapeutic 
strategy for various diseases. It is well-documented that exercise maintains and 
restores homeostasis at the organismal, tissue, cellular, and molecular levels 
to stimulate positive physiological adaptations that consequently protect 
against various pathological conditions. Here we mainly summarize how 
moderate-intensity exercise affects the major hallmarks of health, including the 
integrity of barriers, containment of local perturbations, recycling and 
turnover, integration of circuitries, rhythmic oscillations, homeostatic 
resilience, hormetic regulation, as well as repair and regeneration. 
Furthermore, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms 
responsible for beneficial adaptations in response to exercise. This review 
aimed at providing a comprehensive summary of the vital biological mechanisms 
through which moderate-intensity exercise maintains health and opens a window 
for its application in other health interventions. We hope that continuing 
investigation in this field will further increase our understanding of the 
processes involved in the positive role of moderate-intensity exercise and thus 
get us closer to the identification of new therapeutics that improve quality of 
life.
