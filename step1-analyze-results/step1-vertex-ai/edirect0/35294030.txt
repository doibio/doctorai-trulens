OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to update the Japan College of 
Rheumatology (JCR) clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and prepare an algorithm for non-drug and surgical 
treatments. This article is a digest version of the guidelines.
METHODS: The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's research group, 
in collaboration with the JCR, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation method to update the 2014 JCR CPG for RA. The 
consensus was formed by CPG panel members.
RESULTS: We raised 19 clinical questions regarding non-drug and surgical 
treatments for RA and developed recommendations. The treatments included 
exercise therapy; occupational therapy; joint injection of corticosteroids; and 
orthopaedic surgeries including cervical spine surgery, wrist and foot 
arthroplasty, ankle arthrodesis, and replacement arthroplasty of the shoulder, 
elbow, finger, hip, knee, and ankle. Recommendations regarding the risks of 
surgery and perioperative discontinuation of medications have also been 
developed. Based on these recommendations, we created an original algorithm for 
the non-drug and surgical treatment of RA.
CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations are expected to serve rheumatologists, health 
care professionals, and patients with RA as tools for shared decision-making to 
treat residual limb joint symptoms and functional impairment.
