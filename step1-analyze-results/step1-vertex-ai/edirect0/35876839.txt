BACKGROUND: Myelin loss is a feature of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). 
Although physical activity levels may exert protective effects over cSVD 
pathology, its specific relationship with myelin content in people living with 
the cSVD is unknown. Thus, we investigated whether physical activity levels are 
associated with myelin in community-dwelling older adults with cSVD and mild 
cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 102 individuals with cSVD and mild cognitive 
impairment were analyzed (mean age [SD] = 74.7 years [5.5], 63.7% female). 
Myelin was measured using a magnetic resonance gradient and spin echo sequence. 
Physical activity was estimated using the Physical Activity Scale for the 
Elderly. Hierarchical regression models adjusting for total intracranial volume, 
age, sex, body mass index, and education were conducted to determine the 
associations between myelin content and physical activity. Significant models 
were further adjusted for white matter hyperintensity volume.
RESULTS: In adjusted models, greater physical activity was linked to higher 
myelin content in the whole-brain white matter (R2change = .04, p = .048). 
Greater physical activity was also associated with myelin content in the 
sagittal stratum (R2change = .08, p = .004), anterior corona radiata (R2change = 
.04, p = .049), and genu of the corpus callosum (R2change = .05, p = .018). 
Adjusting for white matter hyperintensity volume did not change any of these 
associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity may be a strategy to maintain myelin in older 
adults with cSVD and mild cognitive impairment. Future randomized controlled 
trials of exercise are needed to determine whether exercise increases myelin 
content.
