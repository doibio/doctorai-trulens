BACKGROUND: Wearable devices have become widespread in research applications, 
yet evidence on whether they are superior to structured clinic-based assessments 
is sparse. In this manuscript, we compare traditional, laboratory-based metrics 
of mobility with a novel accelerometry-based measure of free-living gait cadence 
for predicting fall rates.
METHODS: Using negative binomial regression, we compared traditional in-clinic 
measures of mobility (6-minute gait cadence, speed, and distance, and 4-m gait 
speed) with free-living gait cadence from wearable accelerometers in predicting 
fall rates. Accelerometry data were collected with wrist-worn Actigraphs (GT9X) 
over 7 days in 432 community-dwelling older adults (aged 77.29 ± 5.46 years, 
59.1% men, 80.2% White) participating in the Study to Understand Fall Reduction 
and Vitamin D in You. Falls were ascertained using monthly calendars, quarterly 
contacts, and ad hoc telephone reports. Accelerometry-based free-living gait 
cadence was estimated with the Adaptive Empirical Pattern Transformation 
algorithm.
RESULTS: Across all participants, free-living cadence was significantly related 
to fall rates; every 10 steps per minute higher cadence was associated with a 
13.2% lower fall rate (p = .036). Clinic-based measures of mobility were not 
related to falls (p > .05). Among higher-functioning participants (cadence ≥100 
steps/minute), every 10 steps per minute higher free-living cadence was 
associated with a 27.7% lower fall rate (p = .01). In participants with slow 
baseline gait (gait speed <0.8 m/s), all metrics were significantly associated 
with fall rates.
CONCLUSION: Data collected from biosensors in the free-living environment may 
provide a more sensitive indicator of fall risk than in-clinic tests, especially 
among higher-functioning older adults who may be more responsive to 
intervention.
