BACKGROUND: Little is known about the association between executive function and 
the magnitude of improvement from personalised exercise interventions on gait 
performance among older-old adults.
AIM: We examined whether the effectiveness of personalised intervention on gait 
performance is dependent on the patient's baseline dysexecutive syndrome, as 
assessed by the Frontal Assessment Battery.
METHODS: A total of 175 older community-dwellers (83.57 ± 5.2 years; 70.2% 
female) were recruited from the day centre for after-care and rehabilitation in 
the Nantes Ambulatory Centre of the Clinical Gerontology (France), and were 
followed during a pre-post-intervention, single-arm retrospective design. The 
intervention consisted of an individual personalised rehabilitation program over 
a period of 7 weeks, with twice-weekly sessions (45 min each). Gait speed in 
four conditions (preferred, fast, and under two dual-task conditions), Timed Up 
and Go test, and handgrip strength test were assessed.
RESULTS: Using a pre-post analysis of covariance, a significant increase in 
dual-task gait speed while counting (+ 0.10 m/s; + 15%) and in dual-fluency gait 
speed (+ 0.06 m/s; + 10%), and in Timed Up and Go performance (- 2.9 s; + 17.8%) 
was observed after the rehabilitation program, regardless the baseline executive 
status.
DISCUSSION: An individual personalized intervention is effective to improve 
mobility performance and the dual-task gait speed in older-old adults. The 
magnitude of those effects is independent of the patient's baseline 
characteristics including the executive function status.
CONCLUSIONS: Even the most deficient baseline characteristics of patients should 
not be viewed as clinical barrier for implementing a beneficial individual 
intervention in high-risk older adults.
