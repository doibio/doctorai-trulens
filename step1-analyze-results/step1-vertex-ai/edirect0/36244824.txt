OBJECTIVE: To assess whether cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with 
first purchase of a prescribed hypnotic drug in the adult population.
METHODS: A total of 34,357 adult participants (53.9% women) with a mean age of 
51.5 years (SD 15.6 years) from the third Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) of 2006 
to 2008 were observed until January 1, 2018. Cardiorespiratory fitness was 
estimated from a validated nonexercise algorithm. Data on first hypnotics 
prescription were obtained through linkage to the National Norwegian 
Prescription Database. Cox regression with 95% CIs was used to estimate hazard 
ratios (HRs).
RESULTS: After 304,899 person-years of follow-up, 5791 participants had their 
first registered purchase of prescribed hypnotics, corresponding to an incidence 
rate of 1.90 per 100 person-years. Each 1-metabolic equivalent of task increase 
in CRF was significantly associated with 5% (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99; 
P=.02) and 4% (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.00; P=.046) risk reduction for 
incident use of hypnotics in men and women, respectively. When CRF was 
categorized into tertiles with lowest CRF as the reference group, reduced risk 
was 13% (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96; P=.006) and 15% (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77 
to 0.95; P=.003) for men in the intermediate and highest CRF category, 
respectively. In women with highest CRF, the reduced risk was 5% (HR, 0.95; 95% 
CI, 0.87 to 1.03; P=.22).
CONCLUSION: Cardiorespiratory fitness in adulthood is associated with incident 
purchase of prescription medication commonly used for sleep problems. These 
findings suggest that fitness should be considered a target for preventing sleep 
problems in adults.
