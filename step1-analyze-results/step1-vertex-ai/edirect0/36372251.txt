BACKGROUND: Volitional physical activity level is predictive of a variety of 
health outcomes, but has not been examined in patients recently hospitalized for 
acute decompensated HF (ADHF).
METHODS: Ten to 14 days after index hospitalization for ADHF, 93 participants 
wore a wrist-mounted triaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X+) to objectively 
quantify sedentary behavior, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity. Levels were compared to 2 groups of age-matched NHANES 
participants: healthy and chronic, stable HF. The relationship between physical 
activity levels and physical function [Short Physical Performance Battery 
(SPPB)], HF-specific quality-of-life (QOL) [Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaire (KCCQ)], and cognition [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)] were 
examined.
RESULTS: ADHF participants accumulated a median 1,008 (IQR 896, 1,109) minutes 
of sedentary time, 88 (57, 139) minutes of light physical activity, and 10 (6, 
25) minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day. Sedentary time, 
light physical activity, or moderate-to-vigorous activity did not differ by sex 
or EF subtype. ADHF participants spent only 9% of awake time nonsedentary, 
compared to 34% and 27% for healthy adults and adults with chronic, stable HF, 
respectively. Among ADHF participants, SPPB, KCCQ, and MOCA scores did not 
differ among quartiles of total physical activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients recently hospitalized for ADHF have very low levels 
of physical activity and high levels of sedentary time, both of which may be 
potential targets for interventions in this high-risk population. Physical 
activity level was not significantly associated with objectively measured 
physical function, QOL, or cognition, suggesting that this measure provides 
independent information regarding the patient experience of living with HF.
