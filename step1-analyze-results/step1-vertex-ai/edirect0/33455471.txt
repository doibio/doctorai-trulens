BACKGROUND: The current pilot study was carried out to examine the effect of 
aerobic exercise on Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium as a function of weight 
loss and cytokine changes in overweight women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighteen women with excessive weight (age = 19-30 years) 
were randomly assigned into exercise (10 weeks, aerobic exercise training, 3 
sessions/week) and control groups. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in stool 
and inflammatory factors in blood were evaluated before and after the 
intervention.
RESULTS: The intervention induced significant improvements in body weight and in 
VO2 peak. There were significant time effects on Lactobacillus (p = .016) and 
significant time*exercise interaction effects on Bifidobacterium (p = .025). 
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium changes were negatively associated with body 
weight and IL-6 levels, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate that exercise training associated with 
weight loss can increase specific bacteria in people with excessive weight. 
Changes in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were not significantly associated 
with cytokines.
