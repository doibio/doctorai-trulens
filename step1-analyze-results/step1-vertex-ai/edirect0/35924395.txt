BACKGROUND: The relationship between resting cardiac indices and exercise 
capacity in older adults was still not well understood. New developments in 
cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enable a much fuller assessment of 
cardiac characteristics.
PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the association between exercise capacity and 
specific aspects of resting cardiac structure, function, and tissue.
STUDY TYPE: Cross-sectional study.
POPULATION: A total of 112 well-functioning older adults (mean age 69 years, 52 
men).
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: All participants underwent 3.0 T MRI, using scan 
protocols including balanced steady-state free precession cine sequence, 
modified look-locker inversion recovery, and T2-prepared single-shot balanced 
steady-state free precession.
ASSESSMENT: Demographic and geriatric characteristics were collected. Blood 
samples were assayed for lipid and glucose related biomarkers. All participants 
performed a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test to achieve peakVO2 . 
Cardiac MRI parameters were measured with semi-automatic software by S.Y., an 
18-year experienced radiologist.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Demographic, geriatric characteristics and MR measurements 
were compared among quartiles of peakVO2, with different methods according to 
the data type. Spearman's partial correlation and least absolute shrinkage 
selection operator regression were performed to select significant MR features 
associated with peakVO2 . Mediation effect analysis was conducted to test any 
indirect connection between age and peakVO2 . A two-sided P value of <0.05 was 
defined statistical significance.
RESULTS: Epicardial fat volume, left atrial volume indexed to height, right 
ventricular end-systolic volume indexed to body surface area and global 
circumferential strain (GCS) were correlated with peakVO2 (regression 
coefficients were -0.040, -0.093, 0.127, and 0.408, respectively). Mediation 
analysis showed that the total effect of peakVO2 change was 43.6% from the 
change of age. The proportion of indirect effect from epicardial fat volume and 
GCS were 11.8% and 15.1% in total effect, respectively.
DATA CONCLUSION: PeakVO2 was associated with epicardial fat volume, left atrial 
volume, right ventricular volume and GCS of left ventricle.
EVIDENCE LEVEL: 4 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 5.
