BACKGROUND: It has not been determined whether mentally active sedentary 
behavior (MASB) and passive sedentary behavior (PSB) differentially affect 
cognitive function and whether these associations differ according to physical 
activity (PA) level. We examined the comparative impacts of MASB and PSB on 
dementia onset and aimed to understand whether the associations differed by PA 
level.
METHODS: We conducted a 5-year longitudinal study involving all 
community-dwelling older adults in a rural area in Japan (n = 5,323). Dementia 
onset was examined using long-term care insurance data. PA was evaluated using 
the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and categorized as low (<2.5 
metabolic equivalent of task [MET]-h/week), moderate (2.5-16.0 MET-h/week), or 
high (≥16.0 MET-h/week). We also assessed PSB (TV-watching time; <1 h/day, 1-3 
h/day, ≥3 h/day) and MASB (Book-reading time; <10 min/day, 10-30 min/day, ≥30 
min/day). To examine the associations of MASB and PSB with dementia onset, we 
performed the Fine-Gray models accounting for competing risk of death.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 606 (11.4%) participants developed 
dementia. MASB was independently associated with a lower risk of dementia; the 
magnitude of the impact was significant at higher PA levels. There was no 
association between PSB and developing dementia across all PA levels. 
Furthermore, dementia risk for individuals with high PA levels and moderate or 
high MASB levels was approximately 60% lower than those with low PA levels and 
low MASB.
CONCLUSION: Providing interventions to promote MASB, which reduces dementia 
risk, and PA, which increases MASB's effect on dementia incidence, can be 
beneficial in delaying or preventing dementia onset.
