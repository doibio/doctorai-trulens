BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can result in prolonged and 
severe damage to the lungs and quality of life (QoL). This study was designed to 
investigate the effects of 8-week Pilates and Aqua-Pilates training on pulmonary 
function and QoL in patients with COVID-19.
HYPOTHESIS: Pilates and Aqua-Pilates training promotes similar changes on 
pulmonary function and QoL in people with a history of COVID-19.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.
METHODS: A total of 45 participants (24 men and 21 women) with a history of 
COVID-19 were assigned randomly to 3 groups: Pilates training (standard 
Pilates), Aqua-Pilates training (Pilates in water), and Control. The training 
protocol was performed for 8 weeks (3 sessions per week). Forced vital capacity 
(FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and the ratio of FEV1 to the 
FVC (FEV1/FVC) indices were measured by a spirometer. The 26-item questionnaire 
World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) BREF was used to assess QoL. 
Data were analyzed using paired-sample t test and analysis of covariance with an 
alpha level <0.05.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 49.9 ± 6.4 years. After 8 weeks of 
Pilates and Aqua-Pilates training, there were significant increases in FVC 
(21.4% for Pilates and 22.1% for Aqua-Pilates, P < 0.05), FEV1 (32.3% for 
Pilates and 34.7% for Aqua-Pilates, P < 0.05), and FEV1/FVC% (9% for Pilates and 
10.3% for Aqua-Pilates, P < 0.05) for the experimental groups, but not for 
control. Changes for Pilates and Acqua-Pilates were significantly higher than 
for control. The QoL scores were significantly different within and between the 
experimental groups, with greater improvements in the Aqua Pilates group than in 
the Pilates group.
CONCLUSION: An 8-week Pilates or Aqua-Pilates training can improve pulmonary 
function as much as 34%, depending on the parameter, and QoL in people with a 
history of COVID-19. Aqua-Pilates training appears to be preferable to standard 
Pilates.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings provide important insights into how healthcare 
professionals can prescribe exercise for COVID-19 survivors.
