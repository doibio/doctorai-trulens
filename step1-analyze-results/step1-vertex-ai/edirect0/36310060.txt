BACKGROUND: The impact of meeting leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) 
recommendations and household physical activity (HPA) on all-cause mortality in 
the Taiwanese population is unclear. We aimed to investigate the relationship 
between sufficient LTPA and all-cause mortality in middle-aged and older 
Taiwanese adults and the role of HPA in those with insufficient LTPA.
METHODS: This nationwide prospective cohort study included 4,960 participants 
aged â‰¥50 years from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study in Aging (TLSA) survey. 
Physical activity patterns were assessed in 2003 and then followed up until 2015 
for mortality through the National Death Registration Record. Cox proportional 
hazards regression was conducted to evaluate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Of the 4,960 participants, 1,712 died of all-cause mortality. Compared 
to those who had insufficient LTPA, participants who engaged in sufficient LTPA 
showed a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.84, 95% CI, 
0.73-0.97). For those with insufficient LTPA, HPA also had a significantly 
reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.75-0.96) among general 
population. Similar associations were observed in subsequent sensitivity 
analyses. The subgroup analysis showed that the relationship between HPA and 
reduced mortality risk was only found in the women with insufficient LTPA group.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that sufficient LTPA is associated with a lower 
risk of all-cause mortality. If sufficient LTPA cannot be performed, additional 
HPA is related to lower mortality.
