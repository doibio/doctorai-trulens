BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Myelin water fraction (MWF) deficits as measured by 
myelin water imaging (MWI) have been related to worse motor function in persons 
with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). However, it is unknown if measures from MWI 
metrics in motor areas relate to fall risk measures in PwMS. The objective of 
this study was to examine the relationship between MWI measures in motor areas 
to performance on clinical measures of fall risk and disability in PwMS.
METHODS: Sixteen individuals with relapsing-remitting MS participated (1 male, 
15 female; age 47.1 years [12.3]; Expanded Disability Status Scale 4.0 [range 
0-6.5]) and completed measures of walking and fall risk (Timed 25 Foot Walk 
[T25FW] and Timed Up and Go). MWF and the geometric mean of the 
intra-/extracellular water T2 (geomT2IEW ) values reflecting myelin content and 
contribution of large-diameter axons/density, respectively, were assessed in 
three motor-related regions.
RESULTS: The geomT2IEW of the corticospinal tract (r = -.599; p = .018) and 
superior cerebellar peduncles (r = -.613; p = .015) demonstrated significant 
inverse relationships with T25FW, suggesting that decreased geomT2IEW was 
related to slower walking. Though not significant, MWF in the corticospinal 
tract and superior cerebellar peduncles also demonstrated fair relationships 
with the T25FW, suggesting that worse performance on the T25FW was associated 
with lower MWF values.
CONCLUSIONS: MWI of key motor regions was associated with walking performance in 
PwMS. Further MWI studies are needed to identify relationships between pathology 
and clinical function in PwMS to guide targeted rehabilitation therapies aimed 
at preventing falls.
