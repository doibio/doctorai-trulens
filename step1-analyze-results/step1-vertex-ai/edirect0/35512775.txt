OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of essential amino acid (EAA) supplementation 
on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) fatigue, perceived exertion, and 
training progression in overweight and obese adults. A secondary aim was to 
explore potential sex-differences on these outcomes.
METHODS: Thirty-seven untrained adults (51% female; 36.2 ± 5.9 yrs; 35.5 ± 6.7% 
body fat) completed eight weeks of HIIT, 2d/wk on a cycle ergometer, either with 
EAA supplementation (HIIT + EAA; 3.6 g of EAA twice daily, 30 minutes pre and 
post HIIT) or without supplementation (HIIT). Heart rate (HR) and ratings of 
perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded throughout each session as indices of 
within training fatigue. Time to exhaustion (TTE) was recorded for the final 
interval of each session. Workload progression was determined by change in 
watts. Differences between groups (with and without EAA) were evaluated at 1wk, 
4wks, and 8wks by repeated measure ANOVAs (α = 0.05).
RESULTS: There were no differences in TTE (p = 0.983) or workload progression 
(p = 0.655) with EAA supplementation at any time point. HR and RPE within HIIT 
sessions were not significantly different with EAA supplementation at any time 
point (p > 0.05). Results were similar when evaluating males and females 
separately, but in females, RPE was significantly lower with EAA supplementation 
at 4wks (Δ: 1.1-2.2; p = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: EAA supplementation did not extend TTE during exercise or enhance 
workload progression across eight weeks of HIIT in untrained, overweight and 
obese adults. However, EAA consumed 30 minutes before exercise may reduce 
perceived exertion during the first four weeks of training in women, which may 
have implications for overall exercise enjoyment and long-term adherence.
