The Japan-Multimodal Intervention Trial for Prevention of Dementia PRIME Tamba 
(J-MINT PRIME Tamba) is a randomised controlled trial to prevent cognitive 
decline in community-dwelling cognitively ordinary older people at risk of 
dementia. Participants are aged 65-85 years living in a rural area in Japan, 
aware of very mild decline in cognitive function or abilities of activities of 
daily living, have at least one vascular risk (e.g. hypertension or diabetes), 
and have a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24 or higher. Approximately 
200 participants are randomly divided into two groups, with the intervention 
group receiving a multi-modal intervention, including lifestyle-related disease 
management, physical exercise, cognitive training, and nutritional counselling, 
over 18 months. The primary outcome is change in the composite score of seven 
neuropsychological tests, including the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, 
Logical Memory I and II subsets of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, and Digit 
Symbol Substitution Test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. In addition, 
changes in a wide range of other parameters such as physical function, blood 
test results, sleep, and frailty are also analysed as secondary outcomes. We 
believe that this study's results will contribute significantly to the 
development of dementia prevention measures in Japan. Clinical trial 
registration number: UMIN000041938.
